# calculator
Project to hone my JS fundamentals. Here's the [link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) for the spec.

I've added keyboard suport as well:

* <kbd>+</kbd> for addition,
* <kbd>-</kbd> for subtraction,
* <kbd>x</kbd> for multiplication,
* <kbd>/</kbd> for division,
* <kbd>=</kbd> for equals,
* <kbd>%</kbd> for percentage,
* <kbd>.</kbd> for a decimal point,
* <kbd>Delete</kbd> for AC, and
* <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd> for numbers.
